## How to contribute ?
- Different branches have been created for each individual in following manner: `<name>-codes`. Kindly check `Switch branch` section to find your own branch. 
![](output-img/branch-img.png)
- Avoid pushing your code directly to `main` branch. Commit in your respective branch and \
create a `Pull Request`. 
- Codes will be merged with `main` only if your code works perfect.
- To raise any queries or doubts, kindly use `Issues` section and upload your questions with proper tags. 
- Recommended to `Watch` this repo and select `All Activity` to stay notified with the changes.
